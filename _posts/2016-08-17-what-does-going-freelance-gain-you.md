## WHAT DOES GOING FREELANCE GAIN YOU?

A freelance designer can offer you the same level of professional design as an agency but at a fraction of the cost. This is the main reason more and more people are deciding to go down this route.

I also believe that you gain a much more personal experience and therefore you can work more closely and directly with the designer and get a better understanding and feel for your designs, instead of passing everything on through an account manager.
